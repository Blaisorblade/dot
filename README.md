Dependent Object Types (DOT)
============================

The DOT calculus proposes a new foundation for Scala's type system.

DOT has been presented at the FOOL 2012 workshop
([PDF](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf)). The FOOL model has
been implemented in
[Coq](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/coq),
[PLT Redex](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/redex), and
[Scala](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/scala).

Since the FOOL presentation, we've been revising the formal model
([PDF](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool_rules_since.pdf)), in
preparation for a mechanized type safety proof. The current model
has been implemented in
[Coq](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/coq),
[Dafny](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/dafny) and
[PLT Redex](https://github.com/namin/dot/tree/fool/src/redex).
